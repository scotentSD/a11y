# Heuristics / Checklists 
Heuristics and checklist are really bad for actually developing a culture of excellence. Read this article to get a perspective on this: [Accessibility Checcklists: Just say no](https://medium.com/@sheribyrnehaber/accessibility-checklists-just-say-no-c9a68c8f2c90)

**BUT**

They can be a good starting point. 
Part of the battle is to make sure you update them as you learn 

Please update me :-)


There now follows a series of checlists that dive deeper and deeper into A11Y with a primary focus on Content developers.

## Content
Content is the most important part of your site.

 - Use plain language and avoid figures of speech, idioms, and complicated metaphors.
 - Make sure that button, a, and label element content is unique and descriptive.
 - Use left-aligned text for left-to-right languages, and right-aligned text for right-to-left languages.

## Global code
Global code is code that affects your entire website.

 - Validate your HTML.
 - Use a lang attribute on the html element.
 - Provide a unique title for each page or view.
 - Ensure that viewport zoom is not disabled.
 - Use landmark elements to indicate important content regions.
 - Ensure a linear content flow.
 - Avoid using the autofocus attribute.
 - Remove session timeouts.
 - Remove title attribute tooltips.

## Keyboard
It is important that your interface and content can be operated, and navigated by use of a keyboard. Some people cannot use a mouse, or may be using other assistive technologies that may not allow for "hovering" or precise clicking.

 - Make sure there is a visible focus style for interactive elements that are navigated to via keyboard input.
 - Check to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout.
 - Remove invisible focusable elements.
 
## Images
Images are a very common part of most websites. There are techniques you can use to help make sure they are enjoyable by all.

### All images
 - Make sure that all img elements have an alt attribute.
 - Make sure that decorative images have empty alt attribute values.
 - Provide a text alternative for complex images such as charts, graphs, and maps.
 - For images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text.
 
### SVGs
SVGs are images described using markup.

 - Make sure that svg elements include the code focusable="false" when they are the child element of a focusable element.
 - Add aria-hidden="true" to svg that is decorative.
 - Make sure that svg utilizing the use element has whitespace between the svg and use elements.
 - Ensure that img elements with an svg source includes the role="img" attribute.

## Headings
Heading elements (h1, h2, h3, etc.) help break up the content of the page into related "chunks" of information.

 - Use heading elements to introduce content.
 - Use only one h1 element per page or view.
 - Heading elements should be written in a logical sequence.
 - Don't skip heading levels.

## Lists
Lists let people know the content is related, and how many items are included in the grouping.

 - Use list elements (ol, ul, and dl) for list content.

## Controls
Controls are interactive elements such as links and buttons that let a person navigate to a destination or perform an action.

 - Use the a element for links.

 - Use the button element for buttons.
 - Provide a skip link and make sure that it is visible when focused.
 - Identify links that open in a new window.

## Tables
Tables are a structured set of data that help people understand the relationships between different types of information.

 - Use the table element to describe tabular data.
 - Use th for table headers (with appropriate scope attributes).
 - Use the caption element to provide a title for the table.

## Forms
Forms allow people to enter information into a site for processing and manipulation. This includes things like sending messages and placing orders.

 - All inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding label element.
 - Use fieldset and legend elements where appropriate.
 - Inputs use autocomplete where appropriate.
 - Make sure that form input errors are displayed in list above the form after submission.
 - Associate input error messaging with the input it corresponds to.
 - Make sure that error, warning, and success states are not visually communicated by just color.

## Media
Media includes content such as pre-recorded and live audio and video.

 - Make sure color isn't the only way information is conveyed.
 - Use a simple, straightforward, and consistent layout.

## Animation
Content that moves, either on its own, or when triggered by a person activating a control.

 - Ensure animations are subtle and not do not flash too much.
 - Provide a mechanism to pause background video.
 - Make sure all animation obeys the prefers-reduced-motion media query.

## Color contrast
Color contrast is how legible colors are when placed next to, and on top of each other.

 - Check the contrast for all normal-sized text.
 - Check the contrast for all large-sized text.
 - Check the contrast for all icons.
 - Check the contrast of borders for input elements (text input, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.).
 - Check text that overlaps images or video.

## Mobile/Touch
Things to check to best support different device form factors.
